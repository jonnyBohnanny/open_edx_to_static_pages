<p>Trading cards with people you play against is a great way to find new cards out in the "wild" and you can negotiate trades to expand your team of Pok&eacute;mon. This maintains that fair deals and no one is being taken advantage of within the trade. Some people make the mistake of trading several of their cards for one rare one they have their eye on and instead end up trading several cards of value for just one good card. Trading uneven amounts of cards is a quick way to lose large chunks of your collection and it's best to swap one at a time.</p>
