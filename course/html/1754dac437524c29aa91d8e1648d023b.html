<p>A player’s turn consists of the following:
</p>
<ol><li> First, draw a card from the top of that player's deck;</li>
<li> Attach one Energy card to one of that player’s Pokémon in play (either Active or Bench Pokémon);</li>
<li> Play Basic Pokémon to that player's Bench,</li>
<li> Evolve any of that player's Pokémon in play;</li>
<li> Retreat that player's Active Pokémon if the Active Pokémon can satisfy the Energy card retreat cost;</li>
<li> Play any Trainer cards in that player's Hand pertaining to the rules on each Trainer card and then typically placing that Trainer card face up in the player’s <i>Discard Pile</i>, which is locked on the right side of the player's field just below that player's deck;</li>
<li> Use any Abilities or Pokémon Powers that appear on that player's Active or Bench Pokémon, and</li>
<li> Finally, <i>Attack</i> if that player has the appropriate Energy card(s) attached on that player's Active Pokémon. Attacking <b>always ends</b> that player’s turn. The first player to have a turn is not allowed to attack, but all other actions are allowed as described above.</li></ol>
<p>Other than the first and last actions, players may perform any action in any order. Players alternate turns until one player wins the game.
