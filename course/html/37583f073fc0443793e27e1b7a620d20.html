<p>Organization should be based on your own preferences such as whether you want to be able to pull out certain Pok&eacute;mon types for battles or want to keep them in numerical order so you can know what's missing in the set you're collecting. There are several ways to categorize Pok&eacute;mon cards including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Type (i.e. grass, ground, fighting, water, fire)</li>
<li>Set</li>
<li>Evolution</li>
<li>Pok&eacute;dex number- each Pok&eacute;mon is assigned a number in the master list of Pok&eacute;mon.</li>
<li>Rarity</li>
</ul>
