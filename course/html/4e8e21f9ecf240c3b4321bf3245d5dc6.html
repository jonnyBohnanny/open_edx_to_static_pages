<p>A game of the <i>Pok√©mon Trading Card Game</i> is called a <i>Match</i>. To begin a match, players need a Coin or a six-sided die (where the <i>even number</i> sides represent <i>Heads</i> and the <i>odd number</i> sides represent <i>Tails</i>). One player calls <i>heads</i> or <i>tails</i>, while the other player flips the coin or rolls the die. If the player calling the coin flip gets his choice (heads or tails), that player gets to choose which player goes first. If the player calling the coin flip does not get his choice, the player flipping the coin gets to choose which player goes first. The player who goes first is not allowed to Attack on that player's first turn.</p>
