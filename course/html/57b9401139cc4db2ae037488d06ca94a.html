<p>If you want to play the card game, you may want to focus on finding certain Pok&eacute;mon or trainers and building a strong team to challenge other collectors. Pok&eacute;mon cards can be usually be bought in boxed sets of themed decks, booster packs, and tins.

<p>A theme deck will have 60 cards but will be more expensive overall. It's a great way to get your collection for playing started because it will give you a wide range of Pok&eacute;mon, energy cards, trainer and item cards, as well as a decent mix of different card rarities. Booster packs will have about 10 cards in the newer expansions (and around 11 in older ones) and can cost as little as $3 or $4. Tins serve a similar purpose and are a great way to expand your collection.</p>
