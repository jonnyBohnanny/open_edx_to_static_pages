<p>Most Pokémon have only one type. However, <i> EX Team Magma vs Team Aqua</i> introduced Dual-type Pokémon, which have two different types. For a while, almost all existing dual-type cards had either Darkness or Metal as their secondary type. Dual-types were also utilized in Pokémon LEGEND cards, to emphasize the multiple Pokémon the mechanic has. In 2016, the Steam Siege expansion from the XY Series reintroduced dual-type Pokémon, this time with regular Pokémon being multiple types.</p>
