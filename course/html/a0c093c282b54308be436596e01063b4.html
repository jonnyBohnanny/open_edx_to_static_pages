<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Damage">Damage</span></h3>
<p>Pokémon Attacks typically cause Damage or apply a Special condition.  Special conditions have their own unique rules. Damage to all Pokémon in play is tracked with Damage Counters or dice. When the damage to a given Pokémon equals or exceeds that Pokémon’s Hit Points, it is <i>Knocked Out</i> and placed face up in the player’s Discard Pile along with any other cards that were attached to it (such as Energy cards).

  When an Active Pokémon is knocked out, the player's whose Pokémon was knocked out must replace the former Active Pokémon with another Pokémon from that player's Bench. At the same time, the player who knocked out his or her opponent's Pokémon gets to take any one of that player's remaining face down Prize cards and put that prize card into that player's hand.
