<p>The Pokémon Trading Card Game was originally published in Japan in 1996 by Media Factory While other Pokémon card series existed in the past, this was the first card game based on the Pokémon series. The first Pokémon TCG sets took inspiration from the then released Pokémon Red, Green, and Pokémon Blue Version (Japanese) video games and initially featured illustrations by Ken Sugimori, Mitsuhiro Arita, and Keiji Kinebuchi. Soon new Trading Card Game expansions began to release with many new artists contributing artwork. Three years later in 1999, Pokémon TCG was introduced in North America by Wizards of the Coast with the Base Set, and worldwide soon after. In 2003, Wizards of the Coast's license was transferred to The Pokémon Company International by Nintendo.
