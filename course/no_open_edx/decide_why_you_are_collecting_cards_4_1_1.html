If you only want to collect and display cards, you have the freedom to go in any direction with the kinds of cards you want. You can collect based off of Pok&eacute;mon types, card values, sets, or any category you can think of.</p><p><div>( <a href="pok%25c3%25a9mon_types_3_1_5.html">Previous</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="make_a_list_4_1_2.html">Next</a> )</div></p>
