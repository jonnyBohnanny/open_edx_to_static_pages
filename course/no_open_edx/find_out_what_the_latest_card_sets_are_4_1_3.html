Pok&eacute;mon cards are released in sets when they are printed by the manufacturers but the sets are spread out across the world in separate packs of cards, such as starter or booster packs. Many people aim for collecting a whole set; there are generally 100 or so different cards per set. Be aware, sets can also have expansion packs that extend the list of cards you will need to complete that particular set. It is easier to collect a set while it's in print. The older a set is or if it goes out of print, the more difficult it will be to find those cards and they will often become more expensive as well.</p><p><div>( <a href="make_a_list_4_1_2.html">Previous</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="build_or_buy_a_deck_for_playing_the_game_4_1_4.html">Next</a> )</div></p>
