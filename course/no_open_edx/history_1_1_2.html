The first Pokémon TCG sets took inspiration from the then released Pokémon Red, Green, and Pokémon Blue Version (Japanese) video games and initially featured illustrations by Ken Sugimori, Mitsuhiro Arita, and Keiji Kinebuchi. Soon new Trading Card Game expansions began to release with many new artists contributing artwork. Three years later in 1999, Pokémon TCG was introduced in North America by Wizards of the Coast with the Base Set, and worldwide soon after. In 2003, Wizards of the Coast's license was transferred to The Pokémon Company International by Nintendo.
</p><p>New features constantly appear in the Pokémon TCG. With the release of Pokémon Gold and Silver video games, the <i>Neo Series</i> (the second series of Pokémon Trading Card Game expansions, started bringing several new Pokémon into play. The Metal and Darkness types of Pokémon cards were also introduced, along with Light Pokémon and Dark Pokémon. These were eventually discontinued to prevent confusion with the Darkness type, but returned briefly with the release of the Neo Destiny expansion.</p><p><div>( <a href="the_basics_about_pok%25c3%25a9mon_trading_card_game_1_1_1.html">Previous</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="what_you_need_2_1_1.html">Next</a> )</div></p>
