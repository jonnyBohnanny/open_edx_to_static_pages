There are several ways to categorize Pok&eacute;mon cards including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Type (i.e. grass, ground, fighting, water, fire)</li>
<li>Set</li>
<li>Evolution</li>
<li>Pok&eacute;dex number- each Pok&eacute;mon is assigned a number in the master list of Pok&eacute;mon.</li>
<li>Rarity</li>
</ul><p>You can combine different organizational methods by layering them. For example, you can have a group of all water type Pok&eacute;mon and then as a subgroup, they are arranged by rarity, going from most rare to the most common card type.</p>

<p> It's helpful to keep a master list somewhere easy to find, like the front pocket of a binder, so that you can reference it and locate a card within a group or subgroup quickly.</p><p>As you accumulate cards, you want to make sure that you stay organized so that you know where to find a card when you need it. Label makers are a great way to mark your binders and tins with the groups and subgroups you have chosen. Also, have a separate space for duplicates or similar cards so that your main collection doesn't become cluttered.</p>
