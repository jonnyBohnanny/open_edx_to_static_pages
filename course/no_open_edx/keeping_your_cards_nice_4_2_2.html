Keeping the cards in a good storage container is a great idea for the long term. When you take your cards out to trade it is a good idea to keep them in a binder and card sleeves. That way people can look at the cards with less chance that they &nbsp;will get damaged.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WMdRUAI__fg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen > </iframe ><div><a href="../static/how_to_open_a_pack_of_pokemon_cards.mp4">open/download video</a><div><p>As you continue to collect, you'll start to accumulate some valuable cards, such as holographic or rare cards. Put those cards into a sleeve and then put them in a top loader. A binder is good for easy access to your cards, especially if you use them for battling other collectors, but using both a sleeve and toploader will prevent extra dust, water, and handling from ruining your special cards.</p>
