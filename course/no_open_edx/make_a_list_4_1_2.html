Being more specific with your list can help narrow down your search among the 700+ Pok&eacute;mon that currently exist. As you start out, keep in mind that there are different rarities for cards. 'Rarity' is a term used to determine how hard a card is to find and the rarity is marked on the bottom right of the card with a symbol.</p>

<ul style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 5px 5px 20px 55px; color: rgb(84, 84, 84);">
<li>Easier to find cards include common (black circle mark), uncommon (black diamond), or rare (black star).</li>
<li >Harder to find cards are either holofoil rare (black star with holographic art), ultra rare (white star), or secret rare(rarity symbol with a serial number).</li>
<li>Some of the most sought-after cards are either full art (cards with only art), GX ('GX' is next to the Pok&eacute;mon name), or reverse holos (holographic sheen is on everything but the art). These cards are limited edition and can be worth a lot of money in mint condition.</li>
</ul>

<p>The card shown above is a stage 2 evolution. The GX indicates that this is an especially powerful card. Not all GX cards are equally rare or equaly powerful and because of that they are not all equally valuable.</p><p><div>( <a href="decide_why_you_are_collecting_cards_4_1_1.html">Previous</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="find_out_what_the_latest_card_sets_are_4_1_3.html">Next</a> )</div></p>
