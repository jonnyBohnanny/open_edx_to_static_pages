Specific attacks may cause the Defending Pok&eacute;mon to be affected by a Special Condition, such as the common Lick attack which has a chance of causing Paralysis. They are the equivalent of the in the games. There are five Special Conditions currently in the Trading Card Game: Asleep, Burned, Confused, Paralyzed and Poisoned. Unlike status conditions in the video games, Special Conditions are not necessarily mutually exclusive due to the Poisoned and Burned Special Conditions being recognized by the placing of a marker (known as <i>status counters</i>) on the afflicted Pok&eacute;mon. However, between the other three, a Pok&eacute;mon can only be affected by one at once.</p>
<p>Special Conditions only affect the Active Pok&eacute;mon in play. Once the Pok&eacute;mon is retreated to the Bench, any Special Conditions affecting them will be removed. They can also be removed by evolving a Pok&eacute;mon or using a specific attack or Trainer card (such as Double Full Heal). Special Conditions also stop the majority of Pok&eacute;-Powers from working, but Pok&eacute;-Bodies are unaffected by them.</p>
<h3>Asleep</h3>
<p>If a Pok&eacute;mon is Asleep, it cannot attack or retreat by itself. It must also be turned sideways (usually counterclockwise). After each turn, if a player's Pok&eacute;mon is Asleep, the player must flip a coin: if heads, the Asleep Pok&eacute;mon "wakes up" and is no longer affected by the Special Condition. However, if the coin lands on tails, the Pok&eacute;mon is still asleep.</p>
<h3>Burned</h3>
<p>The Burned Special Condition is the newest Special Condition, officially recognized in 2002 upon the release of the . The Burned Special Condition is similar to the Poisoned Special Condition. A rule change in 2016 taking effect with the release of altered the procedure for a burn. The Burned Special Condition is derived from , in which 's Char attack caused a condition exactly like Burned. Char was not recognized as a Special Condition.</p>
<p>Prior to Sun &amp; Moon, once a Pok&eacute;mon is burned, a Burn marker is placed on it, and the player must flip a coin in between turns. If the coin lands on tails, two damage counters are placed on the Pok&eacute;mon. Under some conditions, the burn's damage may be increased by the effect of an attack, an Ability, or a Stadium card (i.e., 's Scorching Scales Ability causes the afflicted Pok&eacute;mon to suffer 40 damage). If the coin landed on heads, the Pok&eacute;mon does not receive any damage but remains Burned.</p>
<p>With the release of Sun &amp; Moon, once a Pok&eacute;mon is burned, two damage counters are placed on it between turns as long as it is burned. After the damage is added, the player with the burned Pok&eacute;mon must flip a coin: on a heads, the afflicted Pok&eacute;mon is cured, while on a tails it remains burned.</p>
<h3>Confused</h3>
<p>The Confused Special Condition is one of the most commonly seen conditions alongside Poisoned. If a Pok&eacute;mon is Confused, its card must be turned upside-down. If it tries to attack, the player must flip a coin. If the coin is heads, the attack proceeds as planned. However, if the coin lands on tails, three damage counters are placed on the Pok&eacute;mon and the turn ends. Unless replaced by Asleep or Paralyzed, the Pok&eacute;mon remains Confused unless retreat or other action is taken (such as the use of a Trainer card).</p>
<p>The current description of Confused was introduced in 2003 with the release of . Originally, the Confused Pok&eacute;mon would attack itself for 20 damage on a tails. As well as that, if a Pok&eacute;mon tried to retreat, the required Energy had to be discarded first, before flipping a coin to see if the retreat was successful. If it was not, the Pok&eacute;mon could not retrieve the Energy cards. As of the current revision of the condition, any Confused Pok&eacute;mon can retreat without having to take any additional action.</p>
<h3>Paralyzed</h3>
<p>If a Pok&eacute;mon is Paralyzed, it will be unable to attack or retreat for one turn after it becomes Paralyzed. After the end of the turn, the Pok&eacute;mon's condition returns to normal. A Paralyzed Pok&eacute;mon is turned sideways (usually clockwise).</p>
<h3>Poisoned</h3>
<p>The Poisoned Special Condition is one of the most commonly seen conditions alongside Confused. When a Pok&eacute;mon is Poisoned, one damage counter must be put on the Pok&eacute;mon in between each turn. On rare occasions, a Pok&eacute;mon will cause a Poisoned Special Condition that requires the player to put two, three, or even four damage counters on a Pok&eacute;mon between turns.</p>
