<p><b>Trainer cards</b> perform various functions to affect the game: healing Pokémon, discarding energy from the opposing Pokémon, or retrieving cards from the discard pile are some key examples. Before the <i>Diamond & Pearl</i> expansion, all cards that were not Pokémon or Energy were considered Trainer cards. Trainers have since been subdivided into categories: Item cards directly affect the battling Pokémon, Stadium cards affect the entire field, and Supporters are like more powerful Items, only one of which can be played per turn.</p>
