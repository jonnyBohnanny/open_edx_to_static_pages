Open edX may or may not do strange things to file names with UTF-8 characters in the file names when the course archive is imported.

Some manual adjustments may need to be made to href and src attributes where the path or file names contain UTF-8.
The adjustments woudl depend on the host that has the files and how they are acessed. If they are accessed from the local file system the UTF-8 in the URL might work without an issue.

Open edX appears to prefer using the un-encoded UTF-8 strings as urls in the HTML sections. For example Pokémon_TCG_logo.png would be used to define the value of a src attribute, instead of Pok%c3%a9mon_TCG_logo.png. It is my opinion that using the Pok%c3%a9mon_TCG_logo.png woudl be more correct as far as urls go.

For example:
Pokémon_TCG_logo.png

may have been changed to:
Pok+¬mon_TCG_logo.png
during the import / export process on the Open edX server.
